So we were excited when this turned up and we were ever so pleased with all the super-ripe fruit that gives it a new world kind of Joyfulness and an easy-drinking tropicality. It's still French though so there is a spine of austere class that makes it more than happy alongside Sunday roast or a risotto.",

True to the varietal, the tiny proportion of Malbec in this blend gives a flowery perfume. This vintage is the brightest, most dangerously drinkable Shiraz to date due to its fine, bright fruit and soft silky elegance.",
